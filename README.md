## Complete Me

Project aimed to recreate autocomplete functionality that will be implented in future projects.
Insert single words, populate large collection of words (like a dictionary). 

Suggest a set of characters and get a list of all matching words.

Words will be show in order by the frequency of the amount they have been entered.

No front end implementation at this time.
